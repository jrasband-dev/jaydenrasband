This is my very first blog post! ðŸš€

Iâ€™m building this site with **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**. The setup is simple:

1. Create a repo (user site: `username.github.io`, or project site: any name).
2. Set `url` and `baseurl` in `_config.yml` correctly.
3. Use `relative_url` in links so they work on both site types.

Check out the [About page]({{ "/about/" | relative_url }}).
